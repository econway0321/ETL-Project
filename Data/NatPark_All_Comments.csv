Rocky Mountain NP,CO,2011,5/1/2011,"RMNP experienced a very late spring. May had a lot of cold, wet weather and several snowstorms. Trail Ridge Road did not open on Memorial Day Weekend, but on June 6, 2011. Timber Creek Campground was temporarily closed in May due to snow. Also, park trails were very snowy, affecting hikers.

Mesa Verde NP,CO,2011,6/1/2011,"  Wetherill traffic counter information unavailable.
  Edited per conversation with Butch Street regarding skewed counter data. 9/21/2011"
Rocky Mountain NP,CO,2011,6/1/2011,"  Trail Ridge Road did not open for the season until June 6, 2011, which is about 10 days later than normal. The Bear Lake area and most trail were very snowy and the first couple of weeks were chilly. June 21, the first day of summer, was a fee-free day. Despite the cold and snow, June was busy with lots of visitors.
  
  "
Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP,CO,2011,6/1/2011,"Road re-surfacing, blocked traffic, and closed parking lot at Visitor Center for a period of about 3 days. Visitors left park before entering, or did not want to wait in construction lines. "

Great Sand Dunes NP & PRES,CO,2011,9/1/2011,Medano Pass was closed for most of the month of September 2011
Mesa Verde NP,CO,2011,9/1/2011,Traffic counters still off-line. Edited per conversation with Butch Street.
Rocky Mountain NP,CO,2011,9/1/2011,"Due to a formula error that was discovered in August for Longs Peak and Wild Basin traffic counts, a correction was made for all months in 2011. These formula corrections resulted in overall visitation at Wild Basin increasing 1,344 for the January-July period, and Longs Peak increasing 43,782 for January-July. Historical data cannot be changed, and previous years cannot be corrected. Therefore, direct comparisons to data in previous years are no longer possible for these two areas, nor for the overall total visits and total year-to-date figures at Rocky Mountain National Park. 

However, the overall percentage increase of these two locations is minor compared to main entrances in the park. Reflecting trends at main entrances, which is where the majority of park visitors access the park, can still be compared by looking at main entrance figures on the park visitation website. "
Great Sand Dunes NP & PRES,CO,2011,10/1/2011,Medano Pass continued to be closed due to flood damage and only reopened in late October 2012....hence the very low figure for this month
Mesa Verde NP,CO,2011,10/1/2011,Lodging closed mid-month for the winter.

Trail Ridge Road officially closed for the season 10/27/11 but did not open after 10/22 due to snow, and it was closed Columbus Day Weekend due to snow. Longs Peak Campground closed 10/11/11 for the winter for hazard tree mitigation (it is usually open year-round)."
Mesa Verde NP,CO,2011,11/1/2011,Park lodging closed for winter.
Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP,CO,2011,11/1/2011,A warm and wonderful month of November with an increase of visitor use.  No fee collection.  
Mesa Verde NP,CO,2012,1/1/2012,"  Entrance kiosk was closed for January and February. No count on non-recs and commercial vehicles. Non-rec number from 2011 was used as estimate.
  "
Rocky Mountain NP,CO,2012,1/1/2012,"Rocky Mountain National Park is correcting and aligning its public use statistics procedures. Starting in January 2012, traffic is counted at Lumpy Ridge and Lily Lake on the park’s east side; regression formulas rather than counters are used for west side minor entrances; Sun Valley Road, a county road across from the Kawuneeche Visitor Center, is no longer counted as non-recreation visitation as this road is not administered by the park; and Hiker Shuttle riders and visitors who enter the park on horseback are counted as recreational visits. These changes will help correctly align the park’s Recreational and Non-Recreational visitation. 

Due to our visitation calculations changing this year, the only way to compare this year to previous year's visitation is to look at the major entrance stations.  Comparing other statistics would be inaccurate.

A Person Per Vehicle (PPV) study is being conducted from December 2011 through October 2012 to determine whether currently-used multipliers are still correct or should be adjusted.

Rocky Mountain NP,CO,2012,6/1/2012,"June 2012 was uncommonly warm and dry so many trails melted out early and the park started out the month very busy. However, Colorado experienced several major wildfires that caused national media attention and visitation dropped off later in the month."
Rocky Mountain NP,CO,2012,7/1/2012,"June and early July saw several major Colorado wildfires. Though none were in the park, national attention and media coverage of the fires likely affected Colorado visitation in July, including RMNP. The first part of July was hot and dry. 
The Longs Peak Campground figure is a 5-year average (2007-2011), as the original worksheet was lost when the campground hosts had a personal emergency, had to depart suddenly, and left no records"
Rocky Mountain NP,CO,2012,8/1/2012,"August was unusually hot and dry. Though the park only had one very small wildfire that did not impact park operations, large wildfires in Colorado affected visitation statewide. The Longs Peak Campground had no host, as the hosts had to leave for a medical emergency, so the figure used was a 5-year average."

• Some entrances and trailheads were open during the shutdown including Lily Lake, Longs Peak, and Lumpy Ridge.  All RMNP visitor centers and facilities were closed during the shutdown except for Fall River Visitor Center, which is located outside the park boundary and was operated by the park’s Friends Group, the Rocky Mountain Conservancy.
•  Due to road conditions from snowfall late Saturday, December 23 and blowing and drifting snow and ice combined with the inability to snowplow, sand or otherwise maintain the roads, gates were closed on December 24 past the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center on US 36, past the Fall River Entrance on US 34, past the Wild Basin Entrance on the Wild Basin Road and at the Grand Lake Entrance on US 34.

• Although the government shutdown continued through January 25, on January 12, Rocky Mountain National Park was able to fund basic services with revenue generated by recreation fees. National Park Service officials determined that by using Federal Land and Recreation Enhancement funds to bring back limited park maintenance staff to plow roads, clean restrooms, and remove trash, the park could restore accessibility to the park for visitors. After roads were plowed and sanded, park staff reopened roads on January 14 to their normal winter status.   
• For the time period in January that roads were not accessible by vehicles, the park is estimating an average parkwide of 200 walk-in visitors daily. For January this is 13 days (Tuesday, January 1, through Sunday, January 13) x 200/day = 2600 walk-ins, and this estimate is added to the Beaver Meadows Entrance January count."
